Installation Guide
==================

Explain how your package can be installed. As we use the PyPI approach here,
you will most likely want to show the pip installation. It is also
recommended to show how your package can be install from source, as some
users prefer downloading code from github.

PyPI
----

The lastest stable version can be found on PyPI and installed via pip.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install package_template

GitHub
------

A more recent version might be available on GitHub.

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/KIT-HYD/package-template.git
    cd package-template
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -e .
