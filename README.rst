Abstract
--------

This is a small toolbox for root-water-uptake (RWU) calculation from changes in soil moisture in the rhizosphere. The approach is described in Jackisch et al. (submitted to Biogeosciences). The general concept is an evaluation of observed diurnal soil moisture decrease and nocturnal stagnation or capillary-driven redistribution. 

For referencing to sap velocity measurements, a collection of conversion tools to estimate sap flow in the active sapwood is included.


Getting started
---------------

The documentation can be found at: http://rootwater.readthedocs.io 

This toolbox is written as a Python module. 
You can install it through pip: 
.. code-block:: bash

  pip install rootwater
